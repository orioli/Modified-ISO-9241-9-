## üì¶ Overview

This project demonstrates a modified iso 9241-9 test to cover corners. The times are recorded in a csv file. Edit target sizes in the index file.

## Blurb
Since its first public appearance in 1968, the computer mouse has fundamentally maintained its original three-button rigid form factor [1]. The mouse is being used "almost three times as much as the keyboard" [2]. Unfortunately,  this intensive use is associated with musculoskeletal disorders [3] that extend beyond the wrist and can affect even the users neck. 20% of computer users experience at least a chronic disorder related to computer use (with factors being mouse, keyboard, sitting posture among others. Roughly 50% have had at least one complaint in the last 12 months [4]. Many ergonomic mice exits and, in the US many companies provide them to their employees. However, these seldom are 100% effective. Why is it so hard to make an effective ergonomic mouse? And, if there are glove sizes, why aren‚Äôt there mice sizes? Another curious fact about ergonomic mice is that they are all rigid  but do they need to? If the hand is not rigid should the mouse be? This question is more relevant now than ever before because advances in 3D printing, the popularity of the soft robotics and other trends such as flexible electronics mean that it is feasible to build electronic consumer devices that are complaint to our bodies and not the other way around. Indeed! The idea to customize and personalize the computer mouse like we personalize our clothing items seems closer to reality, yet no shop stocks computer mice sizes. On the other hand, many computer users and hobbyists regularly post ergonomic photos of their mods of keyboards and mice on Reddit channels. Competitions such as the Bambulab Mouse competition have shown that the maker community is also incredibly creative when given a working framework and a standard electronic kit. Here we showcase another direction that we feel is unexplored in mice ergonomic and in mice design: compliance and flexibility.
