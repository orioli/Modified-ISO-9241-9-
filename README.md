## Blurb
Since its first public appearance in 1968, the computer mouse has fundamentally maintained its original three-button rigid form factor [1]. Since then ‚Äì bar the trackpad/laptop combo, computer users have only increased the time they spend interacting with these devices, with the mouse being used "almost three times as much as the keyboard" [2]. Unfortunately,  this intensive use is associated with musculoskeletal disorders [3] that extend beyond the wrist and can affect even the users neck. Disturbingly, studies report that about 20% of computer users experience at least a chronic disorder related to computer use (with factors being mouse, keyboard, sitting posture among others. Roughly 50% have had at least one complaint in the last 12 months [4]. A flurry of ergonomic mice exits and, in the US many companies provide them to their employees for legal reasons. However, these seldom are 100% effective. Why is it so hard to make an effective ergonomic mouse? And, if there are glove sizes, why aren‚Äôt there mice sizes? Another curious fact about ergonomic and normal mice is that they are all rigid, but do they need to? If the hand is not rigid should the mouse be? This question is more relevant now than ever before because advances in 3D printing, the popularity of the soft robotics and other trends such as flexible electronics mean that it is feasible to build electronic consumer devices that are complaint to our bodies and not the other way around. Indeed! The idea to customize and personalize the computer mouse like we personalize our clothing items seems closer to reality, yet no shop stocks computer mice sizes. On the other hand, many computer users and hobbyists regularly post ergonomic photos of their mods of keyboards and mice on Reddit channels. Competitions such as the Bambulab Mouse competition have shown that the maker community is also incredibly creative when given a working framework and a standard electronic kit. Here we showcase another direction that we feel is unexplored in mice ergonomic and in mice design: compliance and flexibility. In Fig. 1 we show a prototype called Fleximouse, an ongoing project that is a collaboration between the School Electric Engineering and Computer Science (KTH) and Melbourne School of Design (MSD). It uses the idea of metamaterials (a pantographic mesh) to embody a squeezable flexible-body mice. Fig. 2 shows how this design allows the fingers to work in a more natural joint range. This expands the range of the optical tracking head so much that the user does not need to reposition the wrist at all‚Ä¶ reducing strain on the arm and to workload.
